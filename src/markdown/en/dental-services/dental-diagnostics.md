# Dental Diagnostics in Gyor, Hungary

Dental diagnostic methods have come a long way in recent years. With advances in technology, dentists now have access to more information than ever before about their patientsâ€™ teeth and mouths. This means that they can provide better care and treatment, and also identify potential problems earlier.

Therefore, our dentistry is equipped with some of the highest fidelity dental diagnositcs devices to aid us during our dental procedures.

### 3D Cone Beam CT (CBCT)

A dental cone beam CT is a special type of X-ray equipment used to take 3D images of your teeth, soft tissues, nerve pathways, and bone in a single scan. Images obtained with CBCT allow for more precise treatment planning and diagnosis. CBCT is especially useful for planning dental implants, as it can provide detailed information about the jawbone and surrounding structures.

### Panoramic X-Ray

A dental panoramic X-Ray takes a 180-degree image of the teeth, jaws, and surrounding structures. With Panoramic X-Rays, a very small dose of ionizing radiation is used to create a single image of the entire mouth. This type of X-ray gives a broad overview of the teeth and mouth, and can be helpful in identifying problems such as Crowding of teeth or impacted wisdom teeth.

### Digital X-Ray

Digital X-rays are also becoming increasingly popular. These X-rays provide clear, high-resolution images and can be stored electronically for easy access and comparison. This means that dentists can track changes in the teeth over time, and identify problems early.

Overall, dental diagnostic methods have come a long way in recent years. With the help of technology, dentists can now provide better care and treatment for their patients.
