## 3D CBCT: the most modern dental diagnostic tool

CBCT is a special type of dental X-ray that allows us to create 3D images of teeth, soft tissues, nerve pathways and bones in a single scan. CBCT is particularly useful for planning dental implants because it can provide detailed information about the jawbone and surrounding structures.

3D CBCT images enable more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, making dental treatment much more efficient. In addition, the use of CBCT minimizes radiation exposure, the benefit of which is also obvious to our patients.

## Digital panoramic X-ray: a comprehensive picture of the teeth and jaw

A dental panoramic X-ray creates a 180-degree image of the teeth and the entire jaw. A panoramic X-ray uses low doses of ionizing radiation to create a single image of the entire mouth. These x-rays provide a broad overview of the teeth and mouth and are extremely useful for identifying dental problems.

Our digital panoramic x-rays provide clear, high-resolution images that can be stored electronically for easy access and comparison. This means that we can track changes in teeth over time and detect problems early.

## How are dental X-rays and dental CT scans made?
Taking dental X-rays and dental CT scans is very simple and safe. During a digital panoramic X-ray, we use a special device that surrounds the head and takes an X-ray image. During the CBCT, the image is taken in a similar way, but the machine rotates for about 20-40 seconds to create 3D images of the teeth and the oral cavity.

Both procedures use low-dose x-rays that minimize the patient's radiation exposure. After the digital X-rays are taken, the images are displayed immediately and the attending physician can immediately evaluate them. The images can be stored in electronic form, so they can be accessed at any time for further examination or comparison.

When taking dental x-rays and dental CT scans, we always take great care and ensure that the appropriate protective equipment is used to ensure patient safety and comfort. If you have any questions about dental X-rays or dental CT scans, please feel free to contact us, we will be happy to help you!
