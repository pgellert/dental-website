# Dental Implants in Gyor, Hungary

A dental implant is a small titanium post that is surgically placed into the jawbone beneath the gum line to serve as the root of a tooth. There are several different materials, techniques and dental implant structures that patients can choose from. This page describes some of the options you can choose with us. Please do not hesitate to call us to schedule an appointment where we can walk you through all the options available to you and we will help you make the right choice for you.

## Mini vs regular implants
Mini implants are smaller than traditional implants and because of this, they need less bone to fuse with. Your gums will also heal quicker with mini implants, meaning we may be able to place your new artificial teeth the same day! Mini implants are made of one piece instead of two.

## What dental implant materials do we use?
Our dental implants are made of titanium. There are multiple companies that sell dental implants. We usually use the products of SGS, Strauman or Nobel Biocare. These are the highest-quality, most-respected dental implant brands, which ensures the highest quality outcome.

## How are dental implants structured?

## What is Guided Surgery?
Guided implant surgery is a modern method of installing dental implants in patients who are missing a tooth, or have just had a tooth removed. It uses our 3D CT to scan the patient's mouth and create a 3D model. This allows the dentist to plan the procedure on a computer and create a template. This template is then used to guide the installation of the dental implant.
