# Crowns and Bridges is Gyor, Hungary

There are many benefits of dental crowns and bridges. They can help to restore the function of your teeth, improve your appearance and make it easier to clean your teeth.

### Dental crowns

A dental crown is a cap that is placed over a tooth. It can be used to protect a tooth that has been damaged, to hold a dental bridge in place or to cover a tooth that has been deeply stained. They allow us to save badly decayed or fractured teeth thus maintaining a beautiful smile.

Dental crowns are usually made of porcelain which has a tooth-like white colour. An all-porcelain crown completely covers a damaged tooth so as to restore it to its normal shape and size making it healthier and stronger.

The installation of a crown usually takes two visits. The first visit is for the preparation, impression, shade taking. We can also usually fit the temporary crown during the first visit. Then, the second visit is when we fit the permanent crown.
