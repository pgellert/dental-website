# Dental Inlays and Onlays in Gyor, Hungary

If you're looking for a way to restore your teeth that's both aesthetically pleasing and functional, dental inlays and onlays may be the right choice for you. Inlays and onlays are made of composite resin, ceramic or gold, and are custom-made to fit your tooth. They are bonded to the tooth using dental adhesive, and can last for many years with proper care.

There are several reasons to choose inlays and onlays over other dental restoration options. First, they can be used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay or injury. Second, they provide extra support for teeth that are weak or have large fillings. Third, they are less invasive than veneers or crowns, and preserve more of your natural tooth structure. And finally, they look natural and are virtually indistinguishable from your other teeth.
