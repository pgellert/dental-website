# Dental fillings in Gy≈ër
Our expert dentists at Perident Dentistry offer a wide range of services, which also include the restoration of dental fillings. Dental fillings are a simple and effective solution to restore damaged teeth, relieve pain and prevent further damage.

## What is a dental filling?
A dental filling is a procedure in which the dentist removes damaged or damaged parts of the tooth and replaces them with a special material, usually made of composite resin or porcelain. The material is placed on the affected tooth and then shaped and machined to fit perfectly with the existing teeth. Dental fillings are durable and aesthetic, and help preserve the health and function of teeth.

## When is a dental filling necessary?
Dental fillings are usually needed when teeth are damaged, cracked or have holes. These problems can be painful and embarrassing and can cause further damage to your teeth in the long term. If you notice any symptoms such as pain, sensitivity or damage, please visit Perident Dentistry so we can examine your tooth and recommend the most appropriate solution.

## How do we prepare for dental fillings?
When preparing a tooth filling, our dentist usually first removes the damaged parts of the tooth, then cleans and prepares the area. The material is then placed on the tooth and then machined and polished to fit the existing teeth perfectly. The whole process usually only takes a few hours and patients are usually not in pain or discomfort.
