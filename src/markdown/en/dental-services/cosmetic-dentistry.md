How does teeth whitening work? The active ingredient in most teeth whitening products is hydrogen peroxide. This bleaches the teeth and removes stains.

How long do the results last? The results of teeth whitening can last for several months, but this depends on your lifestyle and habits. For example, if you smoke or drink coffee, your results may not last as long.

What are the side effects of teeth whitening? The most common side effect is temporary sensitivity of the teeth and gums. This usually goes away within a few days. Some people may also experience irritation of the soft tissues in the mouth, such as the lips, tongue, and cheeks. If this occurs, it is important to stop using the product and seek medical attention.
