## Complete oral surgery services at Perident Dentistry

- **Simple tooth extraction:**
A simple tooth extraction is a procedure in which the dentist removes the problem tooth. Local anesthesia is used during the procedure, so the intervention is painless.

- **Oral surgical removal of wisdom teeth:**
Wisdom teeth are the last teeth in the jaw and usually appear around the age of 18-20. Erupting wisdom teeth can often be a problem, for example, if the wisdom tooth comes out crooked or if there is not enough space for the wisdom tooth, it can start to displace other teeth. It also doesn't help that the wisdom teeth located at the back are more difficult to reach during brushing, so there is a greater chance that they will start to decay. In order to solve these problems, oral surgery and the extraction of wisdom teeth may be necessary.

- **Root treatment, root tip resection:**
A root tip resection is a procedure in which the dentist removes the tip of the tooth root and the inflamed tissue around it. The procedure is usually used when the tooth can still be saved despite damage or inflammation of the root tip.

- **Cyst surgeries:**
An oral cyst is a fluid-filled cavity in the oral cavity that is usually painless, but if left untreated, it can lead to more serious problems due to damage to the surrounding tissue. During cyst surgery, cysts are removed to prevent possible complications.

- **Bone graft, sinus-elevated:**
There is less bone available in the back of our oral cavity due to the sinuses. The sinus (maxillary sinus) is the largest air space around the mouth and often makes it difficult to place a [dental implant](/dental-services/cosmetic-dentistry/dental-implants-gyor) because the implant can penetrate beyond the bone into the sinus area. In this case, we can perform a sinus lift in order to increase the amount of bone under the implant. During the treatment, the bottom of the sinus is raised and bone is placed in the created space (from the mouth or substitute material). This allows us to place longer, more stable and more durable implants in our patients. Of course, this treatment does not affect the functioning of the sinuses.

- **Sinus closure, sinus closure:**
During oral surgery, an opening can occur between the oral cavity and the cheek cavity (maxillary sinus). This must be closed as soon as possible so that the fluids of the two cavities do not mix with each other. This closing procedure is called sinus closure.
