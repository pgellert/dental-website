## Complete oral surgery services at Perident Dentistry

- **Simple tooth extraction:**
A simple tooth extraction is a procedure in which the dentist removes the problem tooth. Local anesthesia is used during the procedure, so the patient has only minimal pain.

- **Oral surgical removal of wisdom teeth:**
Wisdom teeth are the teeth that usually appear when the last teeth in the jaw grow, and problems such as the rotation of the teeth, partial breakthrough or even displacement of the teeth right next to them can often develop. If these types of problems occur, oral surgery may be necessary.

- **Root treatment, root tip resection:**
A root tip resection is a procedure in which the doctor removes the tip of the tooth root and the inflamed tissue around it. The procedure is usually used when the root apex is damaged or inflamed to such an extent that it is necessary to save the tooth.

- **Cyst surgeries:**
Oral cysts are fluid-filled cavities in the mouth that are usually painless, but if left untreated, they can lead to more serious problems due to damage to the surrounding tissue. Cyst surgeries remove cysts during the procedure to prevent possible complications.

- **Sinus closure (sinus closure):**
There is less bone available in the back of our oral cavity due to the sinuses. The maxillary sinus is the largest air space in the body and often makes dental implant placement difficult because it encroaches on the area of bone where the implant is to be placed. In this case, a sinus lift can be performed in order to increase the amount of bone in the implant. During the treatment, the bottom of the sinus is raised and bone is placed in the created space (from the mouth or substitute material). This allows the insertion of longer, more stable and more durable implants. Of course, this treatment does not affect the functioning of the sinuses.

- **Bone transplant:**
Bone grafting is an oral surgical procedure in which bone substitute material is inserted into the jawbone to help stabilize new dental implants or traditional dentures. The effectiveness of bone grafting depends on the quantity and quality of the implanted bone substitute material and the condition of the jawbone.
