## Root canal therapy

Root canal therapy (also called Endodontics) is a dental procedure to treat the inside of a tooth. It is a painless procedure and its aim is to save the tooth by removing the infection from the root canal. Without root canal therapy, the infection may spread through the root canal system, which could eventually lead to an abscess, causing a great deal of discomfort.

Our dentist performs the treatment in three simple steps. First, the local anaesthetic is used to ensure the treatment is painless. Next, the root is cleaned. Finally, a temporary filling is put in to prevent any further infection. At a later visit, the tooth is checked to confirm the infection has cleared. At that point, a permanent filling is put in.

Root canal treatment is a skilled procedure, which our dentist has over 20 years of experienced in. Don't hesitate to call us to schedule a free appointment where we can answer your questions about root canal therapy.

## Bone grafting

Implants require a certain amount of bone in the jaw to be effective.

If the amount of bone is insufficient, we can use bone grafting to increase the height and width of the bone to make sure that we can fit an implant.

There are multiple ways and techniques used for bone grafting. We can include bone from your mouth or use a mineral substitute. Our dentist will discuss with you the best option for your particular case.

## Sinus lift

There is less bone available at the back of our oral cavity due to the sinuses. The maxillary sinus is largest air space in the body and it often makes installing a dental implant hard because it encroaches on the area of bone in which we wish to place an implant. In this case, a sinus lift can be performed to increase the amount of bone for the implant. During this treatment, we lift the floor of the sinus and place bone (from your mouth or a substitute material) in the created space. This allows longer, more stable and durable implants to be fitted. Rest assured that this treatment does not affect the functioning of your sinuses.

This procedure requires a precise treatment, and you can rely on our dentist's over 20 years of experience in oral surgery. 

## Wisdom teeth removal

Wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt in the mouth, typically appearing in the late teenage years or early twenties. While some people have no problems with their wisdom teeth and they come in without issue, others may experience pain, crowding, or other problems that warrant removal.

If your wisdom teeth are causing problems or are unlikely to come in properly, you should contact us and we may recommend that they be removed. Wisdom teeth removal is one of the most common dental procedures, and it is typically performed under local anesthesia.

After your wisdom teeth are removed, you can expect some swelling and discomfort. We will give you specific instructions on how to care for your mouth and manage any pain.

If you are considering wisdom teeth removal, schedule a free appointment with us to learn more about the procedure and what to expect. We can help you determine if removal is necessary and answer any questions you have.

## Root resection

Root resection is a type of surgery that is used to remove part of a tooth's root. This procedure is typically needed when the root is damaged or infected. This type of srugery is often recommended when the tooth is already fitted with a dental crown or a bridge. The surgery is performed by making an incision in the gums and then removing the damaged or infected root.

## Small cyst removal

A jaw cyst removal is a surgical procedure where the cyst is typically removed through a small incision in the jaw. The surgery usually takes less than an hour to complete. Afterwards the cyst will be sent to a special pathologist for analysis.

We regularly remove small cysts using local anaesthetic, however, large cysts are removed under general anaesthetic, which we do not perform at our practice. Please contact us to discuss how we can help you with your cyst removal.
