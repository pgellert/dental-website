## Bone grafting

Implants require a certain amount of bone in the jaw to be effective.

If the amount of bone is insufficient, we can use bone grafting to increase the height and width of the bone to ensure that we can fit an implant.

There are multiple ways and techniques used for bone grafting. We can include bone from your mouth or use a mineral substitute. Our dentist will discuss with you the best option for your particular case.

## Sinus lift

There is less bone available at the back of our oral cavity due to the sinuses. The maxillary sinus is largest air space in the body and it often makes installing a dental implant hard because it encroaches on the area of bone in which we wish to place an implant. In this case, a sinus lift can be performed to increase the amount of bone for the implant. During this treatment, we lift the floor of the sinus and place bone (from your mouth or a substitute material) in the created space. This allows longer, more stable and durable implants to be fitted. Rest assured that this treatment does not affect the functioning of your sinuses.

This procedure requires a precise treatment, and you can rely on our dentist's over 20 years of experience in oral surgery. 

## Tooth removal

If the tooth is demaged to a degree that it cannot be saved using endodontics (root canal therapy), or if the tooth is in a bad position we may have to remove the tooth.

We offer a tooth removal service that is quick and painless. We use the latest technology to remove your tooth quickly and efficiently.

## Wisdom teeth removal

Wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt in the mouth, typically appearing in the late teenage years or early twenties. While some people have no problems with their wisdom teeth and they come in without issue, others may experience pain, crowding, or other problems that warrant removal.

If your wisdom teeth are causing problems or are unlikely to come in properly, you should contact us and we may recommend that they be removed. Wisdom teeth removal is one of the most common dental procedures, and it is typically performed under local anesthesia.

After your wisdom teeth are removed, you can expect some swelling and discomfort. We will give you specific instructions on how to care for your mouth and manage any pain.

If you are considering wisdom teeth removal, schedule a free appointment with us to learn more about the procedure and what to expect. We can help you determine if removal is necessary and answer any questions you have.

## Root resection

Root resection is a type of surgery that is used to remove part of a tooth's root. This procedure is typically needed when the root is damaged or infected. This type of surgery is often recommended when the tooth is already fitted with a dental crown or a bridge. The surgery is performed by making an incision in the gums and then removing the damaged or infected root.

## Small cyst removal

A jaw cyst removal is a surgical procedure where the cyst is typically removed through a small incision in the jaw. The surgery usually takes less than an hour to complete. Afterwards the cyst will be sent to a special pathologist for analysis.

We regularly remove small cysts using local anaesthetic, however, large cysts are removed under general anaesthetic, which we do not perform at our practice. Please contact us to discuss how we can help you with your cyst removal.
