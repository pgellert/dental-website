## Oral Hygiene
It’s no secret that oral hygiene is important. We’ve been told since we were little to brush our teeth twice a day and to floss at least once. But why is oral hygiene so important? And what can we do to make sure we’re taking care of our teeth and gums?

Our mouths are full of bacteria. Some of this bacteria is helpful, but some of it can lead to tooth decay and gum disease. To prevent this, we need to brush our teeth regularly to remove the plaque that buildups up on our teeth. We also need to floss to remove the plaque and bacteria that are between our teeth.

In addition to brushing and flossing, there are other things we can do to keep our mouths healthy. Drinking plenty of water helps rinse away food and bacteria. And avoiding sugary and acidic foods can help prevent tooth decay.

Taking care of our teeth and gums is important for our overall health. Oral hygiene can help prevent tooth decay and gum disease, both of which can lead to other health problems. So be sure to brush, floss, and drink plenty of water!

We also advise people to visit us or any other dental hygienist at least once a year for a regular checkup. This is an affordable dental treatment where we clean your teeth to a higher degree than you can at home. It is also a good way to make sure we notice any degradation in your oral health so that we can prevent any dental problems instead of having to treat it, which is obviously more costly.

## Fissure sealants

Fissure sealants are a dental treatment to help protect the teeth from decay-causing elements. They are materials that act as covers for the pits and grooves of the teeth. They help prevent bacteria, as well as food debris, from getting stuck in hard-to-clean areas of the teeth. They create a smooth surface which makes it easy to clean and prevents bacteria build-up.

Applying sealants is a simple and painless procedure. There is no drilling required. After cleaning the tooth properly, we apply the sealant which hardens to form a protective layer around the tooth.

Fissure sealants are most effective when applied as soon as the tooth has erupted. This is usually at the age of six or seven. In some kids though, the back teeth can come through earlier, sometimes by age five.

### White fillings
A white filling, also known as a composite filling, is a tooth-coloured resin and glass mixture used to restore decayed or broken teeth.

A white filling is a type of tooth-colored filling that is used to restore teeth that have been damaged by cavities or other types of tooth damage. White fillings are made from a durable, tooth-colored composite resin material that is designed to match the color of your natural teeth.

The advantages of white fillings over traditional silver fillings include:
- White fillings are less visible than silver fillings and blend in with your natural tooth color.
- White fillings are less likely to cause sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures.
- White fillings can be used to restore small cavities and minor tooth damage.

If you are considering getting a white filling, our skilled dentists at our state-of-the-art dental facility can help you decide if a white filling is the best option for you. We offer a wide range of dental services, including white fillings, so we can help you find the most appropriate dental treatment for you. Call us today to schedule a consultation.

### Gum Disease
Gum disease is an infection of the gums that can progress to affect the bone supporting the teeth. It is caused by plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth. If not removed, plaque can harden into tartar, which promotes gum disease. Symptoms of gum disease include bleeding, red, and swollen gums. If left untreated, gum disease can lead to tooth loss.

Gum disease is treated by removing the plaque and tartar from the teeth. This can be done by brushing and flossing regularly, as well as visiting the dentist for professional cleanings. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the tartar from the teeth.

You can schedule an appointment with us to assess your oral hygiene and we can perform a gum disease treatment for you if that is required.

### Endodontics (root canal therapy)

Endodontics, also known as root canal therapy, is a treatment used to save a tooth that is badly decayed or infected. The procedure involves removing the damaged or infected tissue from inside the tooth, and then filling and sealing the tooth.

Endodontics is usually needed when the tooth decay or infection has reached the pulp, which is the innermost layer of the tooth. The pulp contains the blood vessels and nerves, and when it becomes damaged or infected, it can be very painful.

In most cases, endodontics can be performed in one or two visits to the dentist. First, the dentist will numb the tooth and surrounding area. Then, they will use special instruments to remove the damaged or infected tissue from inside the tooth. Once the tooth is clean, they will fill it with a sealing material.

If you have a tooth that is badly decayed or infected, endodontics may be the best option to save it. The procedure can be performed in one or two visits to the dentist, and it can help relieve the pain and restore the function of the tooth.
